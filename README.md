# Yu-Gi-Oh! Marketplace

This website is just a personal project to guide my studies in Web development, and it is currently in a "work in progress" state. As of right now, it is in an extremely early state, and I intend to update it as I have free time.

## Objectives

-   Learn about the selected tech stack;
-   Develop my self-study capabilities;
-   Start off my Web developer portfolio;
-   Getting familiar with a Linux development environment (using WSL), as well as Git.

## Tech stack

-   Python 3.9.10 (with Django 4.0.2 and Django REST Framework 3.13.1);
-   Node.js 17.5.0 (with React 17.0.2);
-   PostgreSQL database v.14
-   Docker.

## Installation instructions

Since the `SECRET_KEY` in `settings.py` is private, it is recommended that anybody who wishes to clone the repository creates a `.env` file in the root folder of this project, then add the line `SECRET_KEY = '<your secret key here>'`. To generate a secret key, it is recommended that users should go to a website like https://djecrety.ir\.
